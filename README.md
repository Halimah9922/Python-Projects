# Python-Projects
A collection of Python projects for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Includes projects using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Each project features structured code, data exploration, model building, and visualizations, with README files for context and reproducibility.

This repository showcases my work in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization using Python. It includes scripts and projects from various domains, with a focus on practical applications in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling. Key projects demonstrate my proficiency in Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and NumPy.

Contents

1) Data Cleaning and Preparation: Scripts for preprocessing, handling missing values, and feature engineering using Pandas and NumPy.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights drawn from datasets using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
3) Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning: Linear regression, classification, clustering, and advanced machine learning models using Scikit-learn.

Usage
