**Climate Analysis of CO2, Temperature Anomalies, and Methane Levels**

Analysing NASA’s climate data on CO2 levels, temperature anomalies, and methane concentrations, this project explores trends and forecasts using data spanning decades.

**Project Overview**

Aim is to visualize trends and predict future climate metrics by:

EDA: Exploring data structure, identifying anomalies, and key trends.
Visualization: Plotting historical trends using time series and trend lines.
Predictive Modeling: Applying linear regression to project values through 2030.


**Data Collection**
Data is sourced from NASA’s climate resources.
