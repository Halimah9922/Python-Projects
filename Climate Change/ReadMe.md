# Climate Indicators: A Comprehensive Analysis and Prediction of CO2, Temperature Anomalies, and Methane Levels

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict future trends in climate-related metrics using global data on CO2 levels, temperature anomalies, and methane concentrations sourced from NASA. The analysis spans several decades, providing insights into key indicators of climate change.

### Objectives:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examine datasets to understand structure, detect anomalies or missing values, and identify trends and patterns.
- **Visualization**: Create various visualizations, including time series plots and trend lines, to present data clearly.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Employ linear regression models to forecast future values for CO2 levels, temperature anomalies, and methane concentrations.

## Data Collection
Data was collected from the NASA Earth Data Website through web scraping, ensuring accuracy and comprehensiveness.

### Data Source:
- [NASA Climate Change Data](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/?intent=121)

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: For predictive modeling
